## How To Test Step-By-Step:

### ADMIN:

1. **Create a Superuser**
   
   Open your terminal in the projectâ€™s root folder and create a superuser. This user can view transactions and link accounts to specific users.

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser

2. **Obtain Token as SuperUSer**
   
   Open Postman, and use the login credentials entered above to obtain the token. Just so you know, all logins would only work on Postman since Swagger is currently blocked by the Authentication library currently being used.
